  <h1>New York Air Travel for the Month of September 2001</h1>

  <h2> This is a dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.( https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ ). It reports flights in the United States showing extensive arrival and departure delays from 1987 to 2022. I decided to filter the data to be merely only New York departures and arrivals from the month of September back in 2001. I wanted to show the consequences on air travel that the 9/11 attacks had specifically on New York during that month. <h2>
